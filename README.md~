My Modifications
=======

I have added the idea of "topic branches", which are short-lived branches to support long running feature branches.
We use HubFlow to create feature branches. These can be a short-lived branch (such as a bugfix into develop), or a
long-running one (such as a project that goes on over several months). In order to support the latter we have added a
new  category of branches: "topic branches".

New calls:

`git hf topic start <project> <topic>`

*  Creates a new topic branch from the given project branch. The project branch <b>must</b> exist. If the name of
  the feature branch is <i>feature/myProject</i> then we should just give <i>myProject</i>. The name of the newly
  created topic branch will be <i>myProject/topicname</i>.
  
`git hf topic finish`

*  This command will <i>merge --ff-only</i> the topic branch into the feature, closing the topic locally
  AND on the remote. Finally it will push the updated feature branch to the server.
  
* <i>The reason that we do a merge --ff-only is that we always want the history in the feature to remain linear.
  This significantly reduces the level of complexity in the network graph later on when we merge back to develop.</i> 

HubFlow
=======

Adds the 'git hf' Git extension to provide high-level repository operations
for [DataSift's HubFlow branching model](http://datasift.github.com/gitflow/), which is based on [Vincent Driessenâ€™s original blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
